2005-2006 Mobile technology is starting. 
-Ian Hickson helped in contributing for mobile technology to advance.

WHATWG - slowly became popular by 2012.

Why should we have DOCTYPE
- It triggers the "standards" mode rendering while the other would be in "quirks" mode.
- meaning it is compliant with HTML.
If you do not prefer DOCTYPE, it will switch to "quirks" mode. If it has DOCTYPE, It would render in "standards" mode.

They are embodied in elements. 
ex. <head>, <body>, <title>, <meta>, etc.
-Each of them follows a certain syntax.
example:
<a href = "___" > (Link) </a> - This will all lead to a document tree structure element.
<a href = "___" > - start tag
a- tagname
href- attribute name
"__"- attribute value
(Link) - content
</a> - end tag
Note: Empty elements do not have an end tag.
<img src "__" alt = "__">
