            <h1>WHAT IS INTERNET?</h1>
                <p>Internet is a system of interconnected computer networks, a global medium wherein computers are connected together via standardized communication protocols such as TCP/IP. Any user can get information, if permission is granted, from one device on the fly.</p>
                <p>1.Logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol(IP)</p>
                <p>2.Able to support communications using the transmission control protocol/Internet Protocol</p>
                <p>3.Provides uses or makes accessible either publicly or privately.</p>
                <p>&#9657; once you connect two devices, it opens a lot of opportunities</p>
                <p>&#9655; INTER &#9657; to cross boundaries</p>
                <p>&#9655; NETWORK &#9657; means connecting devices</p>
                <h1>INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT)</h1>
                <p>&#9657; It is any appliance that can connect to the network. Can be accessed remotely. Examples of these are Smart cars, Smart Toothbrush, etc.</p>


                <p>Protocols</p>
                    <p>&#9657; Communication standards,rules of communicating into the network.
                        <br> e.g HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol), SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and FTP(File Transfer Protocol).</p>



                <p>Serial Connection</p>
                    <p>&#9657; one wire connecting 2 computers and is also a binary connection.</p>

           <p>&#9657;HTTP resources are identified using URIs (RFC 3986),or, more specifically, HTTP URLs</p> 
           <p>  scheme (HTTP/HTTPS/ISBN/UPC/URI/URN)</p>
           <p>  authority</p>
           <p> &#9657; User information or authentication credentials(deprecated)</p>
           <p> &#9657; Host - which hosts the servers and proxies.</p>
           <p> &#9657; Domain Name - resolved to an IP address using DNS of the server where the resource resides (or will be created)</p>
           <p> Port Number - these numbers define what port you are using. The standard port of HTTP is 80.</p>
           <p>  Path to Resource - resolved to the document root on the server</p>
           <p> &#9657; May refer to a static or dynamic resource.</p>
           <p>  Query - a string is part of the Uniform Resource Locator(URL). It contains data that is not inline with the path structure.</p>
           <p> Typically provided as key value pairs, with ampersan (&amp;) separators between key/value pairs.</p>
           <p> &#9657;May be URL-encoded.</p>

                        The first digit is the one which is the response of a certain class. There are 5:<dt> 1(Informational), 2(Success), 3(Redirection), 4(Client), and 5(Server).The next two digits of the code are defined
                        and specified from the result of the code.</dt></li>
                    <li>Reason Phrase - These are the phrases which define the status code that would occur. e.g you achieved 404: meaning the file is not found.</li>
